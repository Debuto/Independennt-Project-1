Technologies used: my personal desktop, software; VScode, github, git bash, google.com (and there massive informational archive), and Windows OS 11.
Application setup instructions:  Setup the listed software above referencing webpages on git bash and html for desired product result. Notes beforehand, this assumes you are familiar with git commands, html elements and attributes for styling/design, knowing how to track your progress through commits, creating a github repository and syncing files between local (computer) and remote (github/online) repositories, as well as creating multiple brannches to merge channges.
