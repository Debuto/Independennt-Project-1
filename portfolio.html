  <h2>Some of my previous works.</h2>

  <div>During my time at Epicodus, I have been put through a rigorous training process to sharpen my skills to make basic HTMLs as of late.

  <h2>About me (My background).</h2>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Education
        <aside>I graduated from Garfield Highschool in 2015. Have 3 years of college experience at <span style="color:red">WSU</span>. Finishing up in an apprenticeship program called Year Up in 2019.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Job experience
        <aside>Following the temporary end of my educational journey to the pursuit of my goals, I have worked in the professional realm of IT for 4 and counting years.
          I have worked for big nname companies such as Microsoft, Starbucks, and Bristol Myer Squibbs.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Why?
        <aside> Now to the interesting part, I have had a mild interest in coding ever since I took 1 after school class in highschool that taught me how to make a simple game in Python. 
          Seeing as how the times are progressing from manual labor jobs, to a more automated and thought focused culture. 
          It seems only natural that I sharpen my skills to a degree if I ever want to make a successful game and possibly company in the future if the desire ever arises.</aside>
